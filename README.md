A lightweight macOS utility for calculating time differences across timezones.

## Why This Exists

We work with people around the world. We have friends in different cities. We collaborate across continents. But calculating "what time will it be there when it's 3 PM here?" is surprisingly difficult.

Meanwhile makes it simple: add your cities and scrub through time.

## How to Use

1. Download and unzip
2. Drag Meanwhile.app to your Applications folder
3. Open and add cities
4. Click any city to make it home
5. Scrub the time slider to calculate differences

## Philosophy

We all stand on what humanity built before us. This app is built with the belief that useful tools should be accessible to everyone. When we share freely, we uplift each other.
